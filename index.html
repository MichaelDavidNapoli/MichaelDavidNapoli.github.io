<H2>I was told I should have a website</H2>
<p style="font-size:20px">But nobody said it had to be fancy, and no matter how slick the web design is you're still just going to ask, "Can I see samples of your writing?" Yes you can. Email me and I will send you links to my work which resides on other people's expensive websites. I mainly write blogs, newsletters, press releases, case studies, and website copy.</p> 
<p style="font-size:20px">"Don't you want to have a professional image?" Who cares about my image? As a freelance writer I believe that if I do my job well, I should be invisible and your audience will never ask, "Who wrote this?"</p>
<p style="font-size:20px">My background in technical writing trained me to write in a dry, concise style. What this means is that I'm not stylistically opinionated. I can do buttoned-up and professional, I can do breezy and casual. I can do wordplay, I can spin a yarn, I can stick to the facts. I can tell your story, I can convey your knowledge and professional opinions.</p>
<p style="font-size:20px">If you found your way to this website, you've probably met me in person or have been referred to me by someone you know, so you have my contact information. Please feel free to send any inquiries (or requests for writing samples) and I will do my best to respond promptly.</p>
